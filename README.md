# mwm-bitmapper

A tool for converting 16-bit raw files or 16-bit png to 8-bit rgb png files.

HINT: This module is still a pre alpha version. 

## Motivation
In order to be able to read high-resolution elevation maps in the browser from canvas elements, the gray-scale information must be mapped onto 8-bit rgb channels.

The module provides a command line interface for conversion and also a web application to visualize the maps.

## Usage

Call the cli tool with `-h` to get helpfull information.

<code>
converter-cli -h
</code>
